# Road Material Recommender

## Project Overview
The **Road Material Recommender** is a web-based application that helps users select suitable road materials based on weather conditions, traffic load, and soil type. The project provides recommendations for optimal road materials to enhance road durability and performance.  

**Try it online:** [Road Material Recommender](https://material-pridiction.vercel.app/)

## Features
- User-friendly interface with dropdown selections for weather, traffic load, and soil type.  
- Dynamic material recommendations based on selected conditions.  
- Interactive UI with hover effects and smooth transitions.  
- Fully responsive design for an optimal experience on different screen sizes.  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpage.  
- **CSS** for styling and enhancing user experience.  
- **JavaScript** for handling user input and generating recommendations.  

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or use the online version [here](https://material-pridiction.vercel.app/).  
2. Select the **Weather Condition** (Hot, Cold, Rainy).  
3. Select the **Traffic Load** (Low, Medium, High).  
4. Select the **Soil Type** (Clay, Sand, Gravel).  
5. Click on the **"Get Recommendation"** button.  
6. View the recommended road materials displayed in a list format.  

## Road Material Selection Logic
- **Hot Weather** → Asphalt Concrete  
- **High Traffic Load** → Rigid Pavement  
- **Sandy Soil** → Bituminous Mix  
- **Default Recommendation** → Standard Bituminous Mix (if no specific conditions match)  

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding material recommendations for additional conditions.  
- Adding real-time database integration for better accuracy.  
- Implementing AI-based predictive analysis for material selection.
